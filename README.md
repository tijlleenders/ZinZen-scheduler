## Welcome friend!

If you like Rust and scheduling algorithms you've come to the right place :) We
can talk big-O, add features or optimize hot loops.

> Please contact me tijl@zinzen.me or open an issue.

## Getting started
1. Clone repo
   ```shell
   # Go to Home Directory
   cd ~ 

   # You can clone into home directory or different directory
   git clone https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen-scheduler.git
   ```  

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

3. Add target for wasm:

   ```shell
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown  

   # Go to project directory
   cd ~/ZinZen-scheduler/
   ```

4. Install WASM dependencies 
   ```shell
   cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli 
   ```
   - Or [Install wasm-bindgen command line interface](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/cli.html) with any dependencies
   - If it fails (openssl, pkg-config) or
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install wabt binaryen
   # [... or DIY](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
   ```
   
5. [Install deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)

6. You can now run the test from javascript/deno or from `cargo` as below:
   ```shell
   # Run tests by deno 
   ./deno_test.sh

   # Run tests by cargo
   cargo test
   ```
